This is a map of a universe that I cannot fully explain

Because it is map of a universe that I do not fully understand

It is based on insight - an experience - and brought to this synthisis using mathematics extant and invented

And is my hope that a further experience - in the form of an experiment - will valitade this map as being a true thing
